# License

All the [V-USB library](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html) parts (the base-file I used for the main integration and the library itself)
are licensed under a __GPL v2__ (they have all the legal stuff [here](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/license.html)).

The rest of it (which is, more or less, the part that handles all the buttons logic and behaviour in the _main.c_ file) are free and they should work under an
[UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org).
